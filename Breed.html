       <p style="font-size:110%"><b>About:</b>
        Chow chows are not usually  social, outgoing dogs. 
      They tend to be aloof with strangers and can be aggressive with other dogs. 
      This is fitting with their history as guard dogs for homes and livestock. 
      Early socialization to other dogs, pets and people is important.
      Chow chows may become nuisance barkers if their alarm barking is not controlled.
      Chow chows are fairly intelligent but they have both an independent and a stubborn streak, so training them can be a challenge. 
       To do well in competitions, they require a firm, patient trainer who has plenty of creativity. Chow chows are fiercely protective and need training to control this guarding tendency.

        Because they are highly motivated to work in partnership with their owners, Border Collies are well suited to most canine sports. 
To compete in their performance events such as Obedience and Tracking tests without registering with the AKC, a Border Collie owner must neuter the dog and apply for an Indefinite Listing Privilege.
Many Border Collies and their owners enjoy the fast-growing sport of Agility, as it enhances the relationship between dog and handler and develops a confident, bold, and motivated dog.

The German spitz is a very rare breed in North America. A breed club, the German Spitz Club of America, is seeking full AKC recognition for the breed. 
It can be difficult to find a puppy because there are few breeders in the United States and reputable breeders breed few litters a year. 
If you find a breeder, be prepared to get on a waiting list for a puppy. 
Though many experts will say that you can expect to pay under $1,000 for a German spitz pup, some breeders may charge upwards of a few thousand dollars per dog
