<h2><i>"Dog Bowls"</i></h2></a>
<p><h3>Choosing the best bowl for your pet:</h3><br>
It’s one of the first things pet owners buy when bringing a new pet home, and something our pets will use multiple times each day for years to come. The humble dog bowl may seem like a relatively simple purchase, but in actual fact there is plenty to consider and numerous options to choose from.<br>

Dog bowls come in different materials, sizes and styles. Then there are bowls for different purposes: the raised dog bowl to assist large and elderly dogs, the slow feeder dog bowl for food inhalers, collapsible bowls for travel and self-feeding bowls for home alone dogs. Prices can vary quite significantly between the different types of bowls, so your budget may be a consideration when it comes to choosing what’s best for you and your pet.For these reasons, whether you are buying your pet’s first dog bowl or looking to replace or upgrade their existing one, it’s worthwhile putting some thought into what your pet’s needs are and sourcing just the right bowl to make feeding time as easy and stress-free as possible for both of you.</p>

<a href="file:///C:/Users/91934/OneDrive/Desktop/mini%20project/Food.html">  
<h3><i>"Food"<i></h3></a>
<p>Each dog’s nutritional needs are different, which is why there are so many different types of dog food on the market. What your dog eats is determined by breed, size, and age. Consider his diet carefully to make sure he gets the right amount of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals for a long, healthy life. Buy the best dog food today and ensure your dog is healthy and happy.<br>
<h3>What is in dog food?</h3><br>
Since dogs are mostly omnivorous, they require a diet containing animal proteins like beef, chicken and lamb, as well as grains like barley, brown rice, millet and oats. Dog foods also contain added vitamins and minerals like Vitamin C and E, and omega fatty acids. Check the labels to ensure your pup is getting the correct nutrient ratio.From Eukanuba to Hill’s and Royal Canin to Vets Choice, the premium brands are often recommended by vets for their very specific nutritional benefits. Mid-range foods like Jock, Montego and Ultra Dog are very popular with pet owners as they provide great nutrition at more affordable prices.

<h3>Pooper Bags</h3></a>
<p>According to the FTC’s Green Guide, which provides information to companies on how to truthfully market earth-friendly products, “a marketer making an unqualified degradable claim should have competent and reliable scientific evidence that the entire item will completely break down and return to nature…within a reasonably short period of time.” In other words, poop bag manufacturers should be able to prove that their product biodegrades as promised. And that’s simply not possible for many brands.<br>
<font color="green"><i>Unfortunately, many poop bags that claim to be earth-friendly or biodegradable don’t actually break down within a year, and some never degrade at all.<i></font><br>

BioBag Pet Waste Bags are made out of a resin derived from plants, vegetable oils, and compostable polymers, and break down completely under the right conditions.

<div id="Dog Beds" class="tabcontent">
<a href="file:///C:/Users/91934/OneDrive/Desktop/mini%20project/Dog%20beds.html"><h3>Dog Beds</h3></a>
<p>Dog beds can be simple or fancy, expensive or homemade, and everything in between.

How do you pick the right dog bed for your pup when there are so many on the market? Does your pooch even need a dog bed? Should you spend a lot of money when your dog is just as happy lying with you in your human bed or on the couch?
<br><center><img width="200px" height="200px" src=https://www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2009/05/best-dog-beds-guide-1.jpg></center><br>
Even if your dog is allowed to sleep with you in your human bed, every dog should have a bed of their own — or two or three or four, actually.

There are plenty of benefits to having dog beds. They can be used for napping during the day and sleeping in at night.

Unlike the floor, a bed will keep your dog warm, support arthritic joints, and prevent calluses. And unlike a couch or human bed, dog beds are spaces that pups can have all to themselves.

<div id="Dog Brushes" class="tabcontent">
<a href="file:///C:/Users/91934/OneDrive/Desktop/mini%20project/dog%20brushes.html"><h3>Dog Brushes</h3></a>
<p>Brushing your dog’s coat is an important part of canine maintenance and serves many functions; for example, it eliminates tangles and mats, keeps his coat looking vibrant and beautiful, massages and lubricates his skin by activating your pet’s natural oils, and keeps errant pet hair away from clothing and furniture.

Different types of dogs require different types of brushes. For example, it doesn’t make sense to use the same type of brush on a Poodle that you would use on a German Shepherd. Their hair is simply different.

When you use the right type of brush, your pet will most likely enjoy being groomed. If your pet is showing signs of pain or discomfort, you might be using the wrong kind of brush. On the other hand, If he is happy to sit in your lap and be groomed, you are probably on the right track.

There are four primary types of dog brushes: slicker brushes, rakes, bristle, and pin brushes.
<br><center><img width="200px" height="200px" src=https://www.hartz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/brush-for-dog-1.jpg></center><br>
In addition to the brushes above, you should also buy a flea comb for your dog. Fleas can cause itching and irritation, as well as can lead to skin infections. Flea combs are universal and can be used on any dog. If you are unsure of which brush is best to use, ask a pet care specialist or veterinarian.

<a href="file:///C:/Users/91934/OneDrive/Desktop/mini%20project/Chew%20Toys.html"><h3>Chew Toys</h3></a>
<p>
A good dog toy will instantly make your pet happy.Chewing is often thought of as negative dog behavior — especially when it relates to your pooch chewing on your shoes or furniture. However, there are many benefits to chewing for dogs that you may not be aware of, which is where dog toys for chewing come in handy.
<br><center><img width="200px" height="200px" src=https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ca9/58f/36474c26ffc824a6ad1101bccd2d015fc7-puppy.rhorizontal.w700.jpg></center><br>
Chewing can help clean your dog’s teeth and gums — like Arm & Hammer, but for your dog’s mouth. The act of chewing helps smooth the teeth and scrapes away at tartar. It also promotes antibacterial saliva that cleanses your dog’s mouth. You may also notice your dog’s breath improving from dental chews! Just remember that chews can never replace a bristle brush. Always brush your dog’s teeth and supplement their dental health with chews.

<p>The purpose of a dog harness is to guide dogs during walks, and provide them with an option that reduces tension on the neck when they pull.

Dog harnesses are made of straps that wrap around a dog's torso, and similar to a dog collar, they feature clips and D-Rings which get attached to the lead. 

There are lots of different types of dog harnesses available, each with their own purpose and benefits. 

On the whole, dog harnesses are helpful training tools for lead walking as they allow for greater control. 

<br><center><img width="200px" height="200px" src=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/8946/3091/files/dog-harness-guide-barc-london.jpg?v=1669273472></center><br>
A dog harness works by utilising a dog’s pulling power and allowing for more control during dog walks.

By distributing weight, harnesses reduce pressure on dogs’ collars and necks to the shoulders, chest and back area.

Because of this, dog harnesses help to provide greater comfort and reduce risks like neck strain and choking.
